# cpwnlib
Pwn library similiar to pwntools but without the bloat and for C, trying to keep it minimalistic and fast.\
I will probably add support for python in the future with some cpython shit, it wont be as fast though.

## Why
Got tired of pwntools being shit and i like C

## How
yes

## Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nnewram/cpwnlib
cd cpwnlib
echo "lol todo Makefile"
```
